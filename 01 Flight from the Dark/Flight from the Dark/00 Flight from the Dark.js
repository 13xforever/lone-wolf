Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.","\n","^Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.","\n","^In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <em>Flight from the Dark</em> — the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson's (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <em>Flight from the Dark</em> was first published in 1984.","\n","^This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden). The success of Joe's first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.","\n","^The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n","^<strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.","\n","^Gary was working as a children's book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain's biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.","\n","^Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of <em>Flight from the Dark</em>. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <em>The Jungle of Horrors</em>.","\n","^Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <em>Redwall</em> and related books, <em>The Prince of Shadows</em> gamebook series, and several books which he also authored.

There they are taught the skills and disciplines of their noble fathers.","\n","^The Kai monks are masters of their art, and the children in their charge love and respect them in spite of the hardships of their training. For one day when they have finally learnt the secret skills of the Kai, they will return to their homes equipped in mind and body to defend themselves against the constant threat of war from the Darklords of the west.","\n","^In olden times, during the Age of the Black Moon, the Darklords waged war on Sommerlund. The conflict was a long and bitter trial of strength that ended in victory for the Sommlending at the great battle of Maakengorge. King Ulnar and the allies of Durenor broke the Darkland armies at the pass of Moytura and forced them back into the bottomless abyss of Maakengorge. Vashna, mightiest of the Darklords, was slain upon the sword of King Ulnar, called ‘Sommerswerd’, the sword of the sun. Since that age, the Darklords have vowed vengeance upon Sommerlund and the House of Ulnar.","\n","^Now it is in the morning of the feast of Fehmarn, when all of the Kai Lords are present at the monastery for the celebrations. Suddenly a great black cloud comes from out of the western skies. So many are the numbers of the black-winged beasts that fill the sky, that the sun is completely hidden. The Darklords, ancient enemy of the Sommlending, are attacking. War has begun.","\n","^On this fateful morning, you, Silent Wolf (the name given to you by the Kai) have been sent to collect firewood in the forest as a punishment for your inattention in class. As you are preparing to return, you see to your horror a vast cloud of black leathery creatures swoop down and engulf the monastery.","\n","^Dropping the wood, you race to the battle that has already begun. But in the unnatural dark, you stumble and strike your head on a low tree branch. As you lose consciousness, the last thing that you see in the poor light is the walls of the monastery crashing to the ground.","\n","^Many hours pass before you awake. With tears in your eyes you now survey the scene of destruction. Raising your face to the clear sky, you swear vengeance on the Darklords for the massacre of the Kai warriors, and with a sudden flash of realization you know what you must do. You must set off on a perilous journey to the capital city to warn the King of the terrible threat that now faces his people. For you are now the last of the Kai — you are now the Lone Wolf.","\n","ev","str","^The Game Rules","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":20},{"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"game_rules"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"game_rules":[[{"#":"CLEAR"},"^<h1>The Game Rules</h1>","\n","^<h2>Basics</h2>","\n","^You keep a record of your adventure on the Action Chart.","\n","^During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess — ","ev","str","^COMBAT SKILL","/str",{"f()":"PCS"},"out","/ev","^ and physical stamina — ","ev","str","^ENDURANCE","/str",{"f()":"PE"},"out","/ev","^.
